Developed a personal portfolio website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, featuring a responsive, modern, and performance-optimized design. The site showcases my professional experience, education, and projects with dynamic components, clean animations, and dark/light mode support. Integrated smooth navigation, interactive timelines, and reusable UI elements to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Key Highlights:

Built with Next.js (App Router) for fast server-side rendering and optimized routing.

Styled with Tailwind CSS for flexible, utility-first design customization.

Deployed seamlessly on Vercel, ensuring global performance and CI/CD integration.

Fully responsive layout with modern UI/UX and accessibility considerations.

Modular component structure allowing easy updates and scalability.

## Deployed on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
